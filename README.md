## Ordnance Survey iOS SDK, an alternative to Mapkit enabling access to Ordnance Survey data ##

### Description ###

The ordnancesurvey-ios-sdk enables access to Ordnance Survey data for iOS based devices. It provides mapping layers and gazetteer lookups from the OS OpenSpace service and has a largely similar API to Apple's Mapkit. See Converting***
