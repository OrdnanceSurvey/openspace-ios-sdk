Description
-------

The ordnancesurvey-ios-sdk enables access to [Ordnance Survey](http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/) services for iOS based devices. It provides mapping layers and gazetteer lookups from the OS OpenSpace service and has a largely similar API to Apple's Mapkit; see [Converting](#converting-apple-mapkit).

Developers who wish to use the OpenSpace on-line services will need to register and obtain an API Key for either the Ordnance Survey [OpenSpace](http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/web-services/os-openspace/api/) or [OpenSpace Pro](http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/web-services/os-openspace/pro/) services.

This SDK is available as a static framework, please see the [Getting started](#getting-started) guide for instructions about downloading and importing or try a demo app.
